# Student Managment System

## How to create Student Managment System api(This is the only crud operation)
#### Define the data model: Define the Java class that represents a student object, including the fields such as roll, name, mark, email, etc. You can use annotations such as @Entity and @Id to map the Java class to a database table.

#### Set up the database: Choose a database management system (MySQL) and create a database table that corresponds to the student data model.

#### Create the API endpoints: Define the API endpoints for the CRUD operations, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. I  use a framework SpringBoot to create the API endpoints.

#### Implement the CRUD operations: Implement the code for the API endpoints to perform the CRUD operations on the database. I use an ORM framework such as Hibernate to map the Java objects to the database table and perform the database operations.

#### Test the API: I use the postman for test the api endpoints.

#### These are the general steps to create a CRUD API for a student management system using Java. However, the specific implementation details will depend on the requirements of your project and the frameworks and technologies you choose to use.
